# Transport Equation with decay 1D
Physics informed neural network (PINN) for the 1D Transport equation with decay

This module implements the Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) model for the 1D Transport equation with decay. The Transport equation is given by (d/dt - c d/dx -1/2)u = 0, where c is 1. This initial value problem has an initial condition u(t=0, x) =  1/(1+x**2). The PINN model predicts u(t, x) for the input (t, x).

It is based on hysics informed neural network (PINN) for the 1D Wave equation on https://github.com/okada39/pinn_wave
